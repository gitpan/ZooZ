NAME
    ZooZ.pl - A Perl/Tk GUI builder in pure Perl/Tk.

SYNOPSIS
        % perl ZooZ.pl

DESCRIPTION
    ZooZ is a GUI builder for Perl/Tk written in pure Perl/Tk. It has the
    following features:

    *   Intuitive interface.

    *   Support for a wide variety of widgets.

    *   Ability to save/load projects.

    *   Ability to dump stand-alone Perl code.

    *   Includes a simple IDE for defining variables and subroutines.

STATUS AND LIMITATIONS
    Currently, ZooZ.pl is still in beta. So use at your own risk. At this
    stage, though, I consider it to be very usable. There are some major
    limitations though. Here is a list of the ones I consider major, and
    will probably fix before a 1.0 release. For a more comprehensive list of
    missing features, you can look into the Progress.txt file that comes in
    the root directory of the distribution.

    *   The preview window displays all widgets with borderwidth of 1. The
        dumped Perl code has it set to 2.

    *   No support, yet, for user-defined widgets.

    *   User can not change widget names.

    *   No way to define bindings.

    *   No way to set MainWindow properties.

REQUIREMENTS
    To run ZooZ, you need Tk804, which in turn needs Perl 5.8 or better. I
    will probably support Tk800 sometime in the future, in which case any
    Perl5 version will be supported.

    In addition Tk::ToolBar is required. Again, I will probably make this
    optional in a future release.

OPTIONAL COMPONENTS
    Tk::CodeText is optional. If present it will be used in the simple IDE
    to highlight user-entered Perl code. If missing, a regular Tk::Text will
    be used.

TIPS
    *   ZooZ automatically defines a hash called *%ZWIDGETS* that holds the
        project's widgets. This allows the user to access any widget inside
        of a callback via *$ZWIDGETS{WidgetName}* where WidgetName is the
        name of the widget.

    *   You can click on the row and column numbers to configure their
        properties.

    *   If you want a row or column to take up more space than it currently
        does, then increase its greediness. Remember that widgets are
        confined to the space of the grids they occupy.

BUGS
    You tell me! If you think you found a bug, or you want to discuss
    anything ZooZ-related, then please drop me a note at
